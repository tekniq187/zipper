# Zipper Script

# The Zipper Script is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to easily compress and archive files and folders into Zip files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

# You will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can check your Python version by running the following command:
# ```
# python --version
# ```

### Installing

# To use the Zipper Script, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory. Then, install the required packages by running the following command:
# ```
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# ```

### Running the Script

# You can run the script by using the following command:
# ```
# python zipper.py [path to folder or file] [name of output Zip file]
# ```

# For example, to zip a folder called "myfolder" and create a Zip file called "myzipfile.zip", use the following command:
# ```
# python zipper.py myfolder myzipfile.zip
# ```

# The script will compress the files and folders inside "myfolder" and create a new Zip file called "myzipfile.zip" in the same directory as the script.
